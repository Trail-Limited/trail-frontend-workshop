# Gettings Started

## Step 1: Install Node.js

```
// In the VS Code terminal (using Power Shell)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Open the project in **VS Code**, then in the Terminal, run the following command to install dependencies:

```
yarn

```

After the tutorial app is opened, select tutorial you want to do from the homepage.

## Step 5: Install VS Code extension
